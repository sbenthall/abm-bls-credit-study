# Variations on the baseline model

## Different kinds of lenders

### Mainstream banks (baseline lender)

The traditional bank. Uses credit history.

### Payday

Wouldn't use credit history when making the loan.

When they sell the loan to collection agencies, it does impact credit history and score.

### Fintech

Profit-seeking (not zero profit.)

Using alternative data.


## Lending terms

### (baseline)

Gets zero profit (assuming perfect competition).
Simplified here.

### Single period loan

As a simplification, each loan has 1 repayment and 1 interest rate.
(This is abstracting -- thinking about the final payment obligation only.)

### Variable loan terms

In reality, loans have both an interest rate and a payment schedule/duration.

### Strategic interest rates

Allow the lender to choose the interest rates to profit/extract value from consumers, rather than enforcing breaking even.

## Interest rate caps

### (baseline)

No rate cap.

### Rate cap

*If the banks can profit from interest*, then it makes sense to consider the rate cap.

## Nondiscrimination rules

The consumers will have a protected attribute $p_c$, and this will have some effect on their financial situation.

### Generative process

#### Consumer types are preference types (baseline?)

(This is common in the economics literature currently.)

Consumer vary primarily with respect to variations of preference, such as discount factor and risk aversion.

#### Consumer types are financial types

Consumers could vary with respect to the probability of different (independent) income streams.

#### Consumer types have correlated shocks

Consumer shocks could be correlated but in a Markovian way.

### Lender nondiscrimination considerations

#### Use of protected attribute (baseline)

Lenders access and use protected attribute directly.

#### No overt discrimination (disparate treatment).

Lenders cannot access and use the protected attribute directly.

#### Penalize the lenders for disparate impact

Lenders could suffer a cost for disparate impact (see measurements).

### *Business judgment rule / Least Discriminatory Alternative*

Subtle issues here....


## Explaining Adverse decisions

### (baseline)

Consumers just get the rate sheet from the banks, no explanation.

### Explaining reason

Consumers are given information about what they could do to improve situation.

(This means that consumers are no longer perfectly informed to begin with. Why would that be? In the case of a complex generative process on finances.)

# Measurements on the model


## Disparate impact -- outcomes

Inequality of outcomes in equilibrium across protected classes.




## Collection

### Collection process

The defaulted debt is sold to collection data, who take on the risk of (non)collection.
The collectors signal to the credit history.


## Credit scoring
