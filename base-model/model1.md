# Base Model


## Dynamics

We will attempt to lay out the model as a series of structural equations,
each one determining the value of:

- A *shock* - sampled from a random variable
- A *state variable* - a deterministic function of other variables
- A *control variable* - an undefined function of other variables, subject to *constraints*, a function of other variables
- A *reward variable* - like a state variable, but with special significance as the payoff to an agent.

We will denote the index of differnet consumers with $i$.

```{list-table} lender dynamics
:header-rows: 1
:label: example-table

* - Equation
  - Explanation
* - $\theta$
  - interest rate decision rule parameters.
* - $r_i = r_\theta(a_i, y_i, [p_i], [a_i?]) \leq \bar{r}$
  - Interest rate. (protected attribute policy-optional)
* - $b = - \sum_i a_i$
  - bank's borrowed balanced from federal lender
* - $f = r^* b + \sum_i r_i ( - a_i)$
  - lender profit [reward]
```

Here, $\theta$ are parameters of the decision rule for $r$.

The banks are considered risk-neutral, so they don't have a risk-averse utility function.
They simply try to maximize profit.

Lender heterogenity: **Payday lenders** don't get access to federal lenders (higher $r^*$), won't get bailed out by the federal government, may not take credit history ($h$, see below) or ability to pay ($y > a r$).

In a partial equilibrium framework, lenders are assumed to have access to funds at an exogenous risk-free rate $r^*$. They lend to households using a price function $q_\theta$. Lenders aim to maximize or ensure non-negative expected profits, defined as:


## A proposal about defaults

The basic idea is that consumers can choose to default on some amount of their debt.
This amount of default aggregates over time, and also decays -- this is 'credit history'.
This is a factor in calculating interest rates.

```{list-table} Possible default dynamics

* - Equation
  - Explanation
* - $a^{-1} \ge d(a^{-1}) \ge 0$
  - continuous default decision
* - $h = g h^{-1} + d$
  - 'Credit history' -- roughly, quantity of past default

  - Update resources available, with default

  - Quantity of consumption chosen by consumer
* - $r_i = r_\theta(a_i, y_i, [h_i], [p_i])$
  - Lender may or may not take credit history into account

## Agent strategies

### Consumer

The consumers are lifetime reward optimizers, seeking to maximize

$$\sum_t \beta^t u_t$$

### Lender

:::{attention} Are lenders agents?
We have not yet determined that Lenders are agents, and how many there are.

They probably have a different discount factor from consumers.
:::

The lenders are lifetime reward optimizers, seeking to maximize

$$\sum_t \beta^t f_t$$

## Bellman equation


:::{attention}TO DO: Build Bellman Equation
Based on the dynamics equations, and the agent optimization problems, it should be possible to write a Bellman equation, which would look similar to the Hugget model, which we can reference directly.

Materials from a prior draft, which we need to clean up and bring into the baseline model

### Limited Enforcement and Default Decision

To incorporate default, the model must specify:

- **Default Decision** Households must evaluate and choose between repaying their debt and defaulting. This decision is based on comparing the continuation values of both actions.
- **Punishment upon Default:** Default triggers a penalty, which can take various forms such as exclusion from credit markets, wage garnishment, a utility loss ("utility stigma"), or a reduction in credit score.


In this framework, we augment the household's problem by introducing a discrete choice within the Bellman equation:
\begin{equation}
V(b, y) = \max \Bigl\{V^\text{repay}(b,y), \;V^\text{default}(b,y)\Bigr\}.
\end{equation}

SPB: I find the introduction of the multiple value functions here very confusing.  $\Omega$ isn't well defined. We need to better figure out how to represent the consequences of default.

The value of repaying is given by:
\begin{equation}
V^\text{repay}(b,y) = \max_{b'} \Bigl\{
    u\bigl(y + b - q(b',y)\,b'\bigr)
    + \beta \,\mathbb{E}[V(b',y')]
  \Bigr\}.
\end{equation}
The value of defaulting is:
\begin{equation}
V^\text{default}(b,y) = u\bigl(\tilde{c}(y)\bigr) + \beta \,\mathbb{E}[\Omega(y')],
\end{equation}
where $\tilde{c}(y)$ represents consumption upon default, and $\Omega(\cdot)$ is the continuation value in the default or exclusion state, reflecting the consequences of default.


### Algorithm sketch

To achieve this, an iterative process is employed:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Guess the parameters $\theta$ of the pricing function $q_\theta$.
    \item Solve the householdsâ€™ optimization problem to obtain optimal policies for borrowing and default, $\{b'^*(s), \delta^*(s)\}$.
    \item Simulate the model or compute the stationary distribution $\mu^*$ of households across states.
    \item Calculate the realized profits or losses for lenders based on $q_\theta$ and $\mu^*$. \spb{why aren't the lenders discounting utility of profit?}
    \item Update the parameters $\theta$ to satisfy the zero-profit condition or maximize profits, often using gradient-based methods. \spb{which?}
\end{enumerate}
